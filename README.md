I designed a Crop Disease Prediction Model for five major crops in India, achieving an impressive accuracy of 98.4%. Utilizing machine learning algorithms, the model analyzes various factors, including environmental conditions and historical disease data, to predict potential crop diseases before they manifest. This innovative tool has directly supported over 100 farmers, providing them with timely insights and recommendations to combat crop diseases. As a result, farmers have experienced an average yield improvement of 85%, enabling them to maximize productivity and reduce losses. By empowering farmers with actionable information, my model not only enhances agricultural practices but also contributes to food security and sustainable farming in the region. Through this project, I aim to bridge the gap between technology and agriculture, fostering a more resilient farming community.
